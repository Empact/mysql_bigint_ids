Version 0.3, November 08, 2008

* Project forked as https://github.com/gumayunov/mysql_bigint/tree
  I decided to fork project for myself since there is no way to use
  bigints as ID for models

* schema_dumper.rb is adjusted in accordance with Rails 2.1

Version 0.2, September 14, 2007
Improvements based on patches submitted by Tomasz Wegrzanowski

1. Support for bigint foreign keys
2. Schema dumper correctly identifies bigint primary keys
3. :use_big_id now produces unsigned primary keys. This was necessary to support foreign keys, above ;-(
4. Plugin is now transparent when run against database other than MySQL. Tested against Oracle and Postgres.
